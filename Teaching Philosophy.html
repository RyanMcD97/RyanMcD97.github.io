											<h3>Why teaching?</h3>
											<p>I want to be a teacher because I believe that every student, regardless of their background, deserves access to a quality education as a fundamental human right. My passion lies in creating an inclusive and equitable learning environment where all students feel valued, supported, and empowered to reach their full potential. Education is a powerful tool for breaking down barriers and fostering social equity, and I am committed to ensuring that every student, no matter their abilities, culture, or socioeconomic status, has the opportunity to thrive. By embracing diversity and promoting understanding, I aim to make a positive impact on students' lives and help them grow into confident, compassionate, and informed individuals who contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

											<h3>My Role and responcibilities as a teacher</h3>

											<p>As a teacher, I see my role as going beyond just delivering content and facilitating learning; it's about nurturing the overall development of my studentsâ€”academically, socially, and emotionally. I strive to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environment that encourages curiosity, critical thinking, and a love for learning. I aim to design and implement engaging, differentiated lessons that cater to the diverse needs of my students, ensuring that each one has an equal opportunity to succeed<p>
											
									
											<p>I also see myself as a mentor, role model, and guide, helping students build confidence, resilience, and essential life skills. I am committed to assessing their progress and providing constructive feedback to support their growth. Additionally, I believe in maintaining open communication with parents and guardians and collaborating with colleagues to create cohesive educational experiences. I hold myself to high ethical standards and engage in continuous professional development to stay informed about current educational research and practices, always aiming to enhance my teaching effectiveness and contribute positively to my school community<p>

											<p>Hi, I'm Ryan! I have a deep passion for cooking, which has been a significant part of my life for as long as I can remember. Experimenting with new recipes and flavors in the kitchen is something that brings me a lot of joy and satisfaction. In addition to my love for food, I’m an avid sports enthusiast. Whether it's playing tennis, cheering on my favorite NRL teams, or watching just about any kind of sport, I’m always up for some action. Sports have taught me valuable lessons in discipline, teamwork, and perseverance, which I carry into every aspect of my life

											</p>

											<p>Staying active is a priority for me, so when I’m not on the court or field, you can often find me at the gym, pushing myself to reach new fitness goals. I believe in the importance of maintaining both physical and mental well-being, and exercise is a big part of how I stay balanced.

												Currently, I’m living in Sydney, Australia, where I’m pursuing my studies at the Australian Catholic University (ACU). I’m on track to graduate in 2025 with a major in food technology and computing. My academic journey has been incredibly rewarding, combining my passion for food with my interest in technology. I’m excited about the opportunities this unique combination of skills will bring in the future. In everything I do, I strive to give my best. Whether it’s in the kitchen, on the sports field, or in my academic pursuits, I approach each challenge with dedication and a positive mindset. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new adventures.</p>
